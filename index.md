## Selected Projects

[Convolutionals Neural Network Model + Computer Vision to Detect Malaria in Infected Cells](https://github.com/chees-ea/MalariaCapstone)
*An automated system using Deep Learning techniques to train a model that helps with the early and accurate detection of malaria.*

[Deep Learning For Recognizing the Street View Housing Number Digit](https://github.com/chees-ea/Neural-Networks-house-number-and-digit-recognition)
*This project involved recognizing the street view housing number digit by using artificial and convolutional neural networks. The model is a feed forward neural network model that can identify digits in the images.*

[Amazon Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/chees-ea/Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest---Predicting-Potential-Customers)
*Building recommendations systems to recommend the best Amazon products.*

[Decision Trees for Predicting Potential Customers](https://github.com/chees-ea/Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest---Predicting-Potential-Customers)
*Predicting the eligibility of bank customers for a loan and recommending business strategies.*

[Dimensionality Reduction Techniques on Mpg Dataset](https://github.com/chees-ea/dimensionality-reduction-techniques)
*Applying dimensionality reduction (PCA and tSNE) on the auto-mpg dataset and doing bank customer segmentation*

[Marketing Analytics](https://github.com/chees-ea/foundations-for-data-science)
*This project aims to analyze marketing data and address some important business problems/questions related to customer demographics, product preferences, channel performances, etc.*
